# PyTB
A VERY basic Python based Twitter Scraper and Post-notifier Discord Bot


## What is this?
Since Twitter has made their Public API fully paywalled, many Twitter Bots broke.
However, by scraping Twitters Search results, one can still find out when a new Post was made.
As such, this was created as a Temporary solution, that can detect a new Post by a single user and send a link to the Tweet to a specified Channel.

## What should it do?

- [x] Figure out when a new Tweet was made
  - [x] Track the Twitter users Tweets in intervals
  - [x] Post to a channel in a Server
- [ ] Set channel(s) within a Server
- [ ] Set tracked Twitter User within a Server
- [ ] Set intervals within a Server
- [ ] Something else i haven't come up with yet
